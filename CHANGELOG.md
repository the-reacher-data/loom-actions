# 🚀 Release 1.6.0 ([#42](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/pull/42)) ([`f299351`](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/commit/f299351c56249c774edd991725b6129383ca9561))


## ✨ Features
### workflows
- **workflows:** add reusable node-ci workflow<br>
  > CI for npm workspaces, one job per concern and one gate: npm ci from the
  > lockfile, lint and type-check, tests with coverage once per workspace, build
  > where the script exists, and Playwright end-to-end tests on a Chromium the
  > locked Playwright installs. A missing lint, type-check or test script fails
  > instead of passing unnoticed.
  > Workspace names resolve to their directories through package-lock.json, so
  > each lcov is rewritten with SF: paths relative to the repository root and
  > uploaded to Codecov, opt-in and never blocking, flagged with the directory
  > name. Every job only reads; the Codecov token reaches the upload alone.
  > The contract tests run the resolve and lcov steps themselves through a small
  > helper that executes a workflow's run: script as the runner does.
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **workflows:** add reusable repo-security workflow<br>
  > gitleaks 8.30.1 over the full history, from its image pinned by digest;
  > CodeQL without a build for the languages given; dependency review on pull
  > requests, blocking at high by default; and a command of the caller's, run
  > with a read-only token, no secret and, on request, a pinned uv with a
  > virtualenv of the Python asked for and Node.js. One gate requires them all.
  > In a private repository CodeQL and the dependency review need GitHub
  > Advanced Security, so their jobs leave a notice and pass. The tests run the
  > gitleaks step against a throwaway repository holding a token built at run
  > time, and the extra check's exit code, besides the contract.
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **workflows:** add reusable pages build workflow<br>
  > Builds a static site with a read-only token and no secret, requires
  > output-dir/index.html, and with deploy uploads it as the Pages artifact,
  > reporting that through the pages-artifact output. It never deploys: the

- **workflows:** add reusable image-release workflow<br>
  > Publishes the image of a release to GHCR and, optionally, Docker Hub. It
  > stops first unless version is X.Y.Z and the GHCR name is valid, and when
  > Docker Hub is asked for without both secrets. It builds the release tag, not
  > the commit that started the run, for every platform given, tags X.Y.Z, X.Y
  > and latest, passes VERSION, REVISION and CREATED, and pushes an SBOM and
  > mode=max provenance. In a public repository each pushed digest gets a build
  > provenance attestation stored in the registry; in a private one, a notice.

## 🐛 Fixes
### workflows
- **workflows:** run gitleaks from the repository and test its configuration<br>
  > The scan now runs with /repo as its working directory, so any path gitleaks
  > resolves against the current directory lands in the repository rather than
  > the image root. The tests cover the paths a caller takes beyond the default:
  > a configuration whose allowlist clears a finding, a configuration that does
  > not exist, and a committed .gitleaksignore holding the finding's fingerprint.
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **workflows:** upload node-ci coverage from a job that runs no caller code<br>
  > The test job ran the caller's npm scripts, with dependencies installed, on
  > the same runner where a later step received CODECOV_TOKEN. The test job now
  > only stores each workspace's rewritten lcov as an artifact; a codecov job
  > with the same matrix, a read-only token and no npm, downloads it and
  > uploads it. A workspace that stored no report skips its upload; its tests
  > already failed the gate.
  > A contract test now requires that no job running npm, npx or a command of
  > the caller's references a secret, in all four new workflows.
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **workflows:** harden what image-release builds and tags<br>
  > The signed release no longer reads the gha layer cache that pull
  > requests write (scope=image), so no layer a pull request produced can
  > reach a published, attested image.
  > The binfmt and BuildKit images the builder actions start are pinned by
  > digest, and QEMU is set up only when a platform other than linux/amd64
  > is asked for.
  > latest moves only when the version is the highest vX.Y.Z tag, so a patch
  > to an older line leaves it alone.
  > The tagged commit must be on the default branch and, with the new
  > optional expected-sha input, be exactly the commit the caller released.
  > The scripts are tested against a throwaway repository with tags on and off
  > the default branch.
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

- **workflows:** take the gitleaks settings of a pull request from its base<br>
  > A pull request could clear its own finding: gitleaks read the allowlist in
  > .gitleaks.toml, or the configured file, and .gitleaksignore from the checked
  > out head. On pull_request the scan now reads both from the base branch into
  > a temporary directory, falls back to the default rules and an empty ignore
  > list when the base has none, removes the head's .gitleaksignore from the
  > scanned root, and fails when the base branch cannot be read. Pushes still
  > use the settings of the commit scanned.
  > The tests reproduce each bypass against the previous step and show it

- **workflows:** upload the Pages site only from the default branch<br>
  > A caller passing deploy on another branch, or on a pull request, could have
  > uploaded a site its deploy job would publish. The Pages artifact is now
  > uploaded only when github.ref is the default branch, with a notice
  > otherwise, and a build that may be deployed restores no uv cache a pull
  > request could have saved.
  > A new fetch-depth input, 1 by default, lets a build that reads its version
  > from git tags check out the full history.

  > only, the ancestry check and expected-sha. It states that the Dockerfile is
  > built in the privileged job, recommends a ruleset protecting v* tags, and
  > warns against building command inputs from contributor-controlled text.

## ✅ Tests
### workflows
- **workflows:** check the new workflows and a monorepo caller<br>
  > The four new workflows are only callable, pin every action by commit with
  > its version, interpolate no expression into a script, keep no checkout
  > token, declare permissions and a timeout per job and leave concurrency to
  > the caller; only image-release can mint an identity.
  > The caller fixtures mirror the monorepo CI, docs and release the workflows
  > are built for. GitHub rejects an undeclared input or secret, and a caller
  > granting less than the called jobs request, only when a run starts, so the
  > test checks every call in them for all three.

# 🚀 Release 1.5.0 ([#40](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/pull/40)) ([`fa9f387`](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/commit/fa9f387931df4c8d046bb4a556e8d40fa698c65f))


## ✨ Features
### python-service-ci
- **python-service-ci:** support a monorepo project and an informative Sonar<br>
  > A monorepo keeps its Python service in a subdirectory with its own
  > pyproject.toml and uv.lock, and the workflow only ran from the root.
  > working-directory, "." by default: lint, test and dependencies run uv
  > there, src-dir and test-dir are relative to it, the test results are
  > uploaded from it and downloaded back into it, and quality-report gets it.
  > quality-report is pinned to be54dfb (the merge of #37, whose actions/ tree
  > is the one released as v1.4.0), the first commit with working-directory.
  > Sonar, Codecov, the image and the branch check stay at the root; Sonar and
  > Codecov read the project's reports through a PROJECT_PREFIX that is empty
  > by default, so every path is exactly the one used before.
  > semantic-branch-config, empty by default: the branch check reads its rules
  > from that file, relative to the root, or else from the pyproject.toml in
  > working-directory. A missing file is a clear error instead of a traceback.
  > sonar-blocking, true by default: when false, a Sonar that fails or is on
  > without its token or project key leaves a notice and the gate ignores it.
  > The jobs and the gate are unchanged, and the contract tests pin both.

## 📖 Documentation
### readme
- **readme:** document the monorepo inputs and sonar-blocking of python-service-ci<br>
  > Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>






## ✅ Tests
### examples
- **examples:** run python-service-ci over a monorepo example under act<br>
  > examples/monorepo keeps a Python service in apps/api with its own
  > pyproject.toml, [tool.semantic_branch] and uv.lock, and a Dockerfile built
  > from the monorepo root. Its caller passes working-directory,
  > semantic-branch-config, image-context and dockerfile, so quality-report runs
  > with --frozen in a subdirectory, which the composite smoke did not cover.
  > make act-monorepo runs it. act's artifact server only speaks the protocol of
  > upload-artifact and download-artifact v4, so tests/act/run-monorepo.sh runs a
  > throwaway copy of the checkout with those two pins swapped for v4 and fails
  > if the pins it swaps are gone. The root .gitignore ignores uv.lock, so the
  > example's lockfile is unignored.

# 🚀 Release 1.4.0 ([#16](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/pull/16)) ([`1dcfe63`](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/commit/1dcfe63cf91e6c9a38b389cda3674e9f176e607d))



## 🐛 Fixes
- actions/python/quality-report/requirements.txt to reduce vulnerabilities










# 🚀 Release 1.4.0 ([#37](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/pull/37)) ([`be54dfb`](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/commit/be54dfb371c9390deaca1c7787d9de261ae17255))


## ✨ Features
### quality-report
- **quality-report:** run the checks in an optional working-directory<br>
  > A monorepo keeps its Python project in a subdirectory, and the composite only
  > ran from the workspace root. The new working-directory input, "." by default,
  > runs every check and the report there, so src-dir, test-dir, test-results-dir
  > and the uv.lock lookup are relative to it.
  > The report paths the action returns carry the directory, so a caller still
  > reads them from the workspace root. The prefix is written before the builder
  > runs, because a blocking report exits non-zero. With the default it is empty
  > and the outputs are exactly the paths returned before; the act smoke asserts
  > both cases.


### release
- **release:** read the branch rules from an optional semantic-branch-config<br>
  > A monorepo declares [tool.semantic_branch] in the pyproject.toml of the
  > package it releases, not at the root. plan-release gains a
  > semantic-branch-config input, pyproject.toml by default, passed to both of its
  > planner runs so the plan shown and the version returned read the same rules.
  > A file that does not exist now refuses with a ReleasePlanError naming it,
  > instead of an uncaught FileNotFoundError. An empty value means the default, so
  > a reusable workflow can forward its own input unchanged.
  > versioning-branch-semantic already reads config-file, which holds both the
  > rules and the version it rewrites. Its semantic-branch-config is empty by
  > default and then keeps reading the rules from config-file; when set, only the
  > rules come from it, and the version is still read from and written to
  > config-file, so a separate rules file is never rewritten.
  > With the defaults, both produce exactly the output they did. The unit tests
  > load cli.py, which imports tomli_w, so the test runs install tomli-w.

## 🐛 Fixes
### release
- **release:** let a commit's breaking marker raise the version










# 🚀 Release 1.2.2 ([#31](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/pull/31)) ([`e594096`](https://github.com/the-reacher-data/loom-actions/commit/e59409611f0de4ecffe889dd0c7734fb23d9bd09))



## 🐛 Fixes
### release
- **release:** let a re-run of a tagged release plan the same version<br>
  > Recovering a release that stopped after tagging was documented as a dispatch
  > with the merge SHA, and it could not work: the planner read the highest tag
  > reachable from that commit, which now included the tag the halted run had just
  > created, so the range was empty and the run refused with "nothing to release".
  > loom-py's v1.11.0 is in exactly that state — tagged and released, never
  > uploaded.
  > A tag pointing at the commit being released is not a release that preceded it,
  > so it is ignored when choosing the previous tag. The re-run then plans the same
  > version, finds the tag already pointing at the right commit, and carries on to
  > the upload.
  > Removing the guard turns two tests red. The empty-range refusal is now
  > unreachable through this path, so its test asserts what the code does instead:
  > a commit carrying the only tag is planned from the start of history.

- **release:** the same tag-on-HEAD defect, in the copy nobody tested<br>
  > An independent audit found the fix for the previous commit landed in one of two
  > places. build_release_notes.py has its own latest_release_tag, with the same
  > rule and the same bug: the action detaches at the released commit and runs it,
  > so a re-run for an already tagged commit read its own tag as the previous
  > release, saw an empty range, and refused. The next dispatch would have died in
  > the plan job, before the tag step, before the upload.
  > That module had no test file at all, which is why the bug survived a fix aimed
  > at itself. It has nine now, including the re-run.
  > The reusable workflow also called its own action at @master while callers pin
  > the workflow by SHA, so unreviewed action code reached a pinned release. It
  > tracks the floating major tag instead, and a test refuses master. A caller can
  > now read whether a distribution was built rather than inferring it from the
  > aggregate result of the called workflow.

### release

## ✨ Features
### release
- **release:** a reusable release for every trunk-based repository<br>
  > Merging a pull request that carries the release label publishes everything
  > merged since the last tag. The version is derived from the branches the range
  > ships, taking the highest part any of them asks for, so a batch holding a
  > feature never goes out as a patch.
  > Publishing to PyPI is opt-in and off by default. A repository that ships an
  > application, not a package, gets the tag, the notes and the GitHub release and
  > never builds a distribution — so it needs no index account, no trusted
  > publisher and no secret. Asking to publish without a package name fails
  > closed, because the built version could not then be checked against the tag.
  > The planner moves here from loom-py: a workflow reusable by other repositories
  > cannot read a script that lives in one of them.
